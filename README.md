First Project (AI): Rock Paper Scissors AI using Markov Chains

This is my first assignment for my Artificial Intelligence course. The goal of the project is to build an AI agent capable of playing the classic game Rock Paper Scissors using a Markov chain approach.

A Markov chain models a stochastic process - one that is non-deterministic yet has the Markov property where the probability of future states depends only on the current state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it. For this game, the Markov chain will represent the possible game states (player plays rock/paper/scissors, opponent plays rock/paper/scissors) and the transition probabilities between them.

The agent is implemented using a Markov chain to randomly generate its next move based on the current game state and trained transition probabilities. It "learns" to play optimally against a fixed strategy opponent by adjusting the transition probabilities through a reinforcement learning process.

This is a basic first project to get hands-on experience applying AI and machine learning concepts. Some things that could be improved include adding more states to the Markov chain, allowing the opponent to also learn and adapt, and evaluating the agent's performance over many games.

Overall this project aims to demonstrate a simple application of Markov chains and reinforcement learning to build an AI that can play a classic game. Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
